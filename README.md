# üéûÔ∏èFrameSense

FrameSense is highly modular command line tool to pre-process your video collections.

**Status**: alpha

**Current focus**: functional minimum viable product. The current implementation is still buggy and slow. Consolidation and optimisation will come at a later stage.

## Requirements

* python 3.10+
* Docker or Singularity

## Initial set Up

1. Clone this repository anywhere on your system;
2. Copy [`docs/collections.json`](docs/collections.json) to the folder containing your video collections and adapt its contents to your needs. All paths `collections.json` are relative to that file.
3. Copy [`docs/.env`](docs/.env) in the folder that contains `framesense.py` and adapt the values to your environment. `FRAMESENSE_COLLECTIONS` should be the absolute path to your copy of `collections.json`.
4. Create the python virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
5. Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
6. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Concepts

In FrameSense your collection is broken down into a hierachy of smaller units. A `Collection` contains `videos`, which are made of `Clips`. Each Clip is a sequence of `Shots`. And each Shot is composed of a series of still `Frames`.

Each operation provided by FrameSense works at on a particular unit in that hierarchy.

A video can be manually annotated in an `annotation file` that contains a list of annotations. An `annotation` describes and locates a clip within the video.

## Expected folder structure of your collections

* COLLECTIONS
    * collections.json*
    * COLLECTION1*
        * VIDEO1*
            * VIDEO1.mp4
            * CLIP1
                * CLIP1.mp4
                * shots
                    * SHOT_INDEX # three digits, zero-padded
                        * shot.mp4
                        * 01-XXX.jpg # first frame
                        * 02-XXX.jpg # middle frame
                        * 03-XXX.jpg # last frame
                        * frames.json
    * ANNOTATIONS1
        * VIDEO1.json

In the above tree, a file or folder name in capital can be name whichever way you like. 
File or folder with an asterisk are mandatory. Names in lowercase are predefined, you can't change them.
Initially each video folder must have either a video file (e.g. godfather/godfather.mp4) or at least one clip file (e.g. godfather/godfather/baptism/baptism.mp4).

## Usage

The tool offers a command-line interface to a series of modular operators acting on your video collections.

To see the list of available operators:

`python framesense.py operators`

For instance, to see the collections and the videos they contain:

`python framesense.py collections -v`

### arguments

* `-f FILTER` : only input files which path contain the FILTER string (case insensitive) will be processed by the operator
* `-r` : forces the operator to **redo** the operation, even if the output already exists. **USE WITH CAUTION** as it can destroy outputs from previous operations
* `-v` : **verbose** mode, print more stuff
* `--dry-run` : does not make any change on disk. A way of testing an operation's scope before running it

The operator will return an error if you try to use an argument that it doesn support (yet).

## Architectural principles

* **Modular**: open architecture so each operator has its own module and containerised dependencies; easy to extend or swap operations;
* **Incremental**: an operation builds on top of outputs from other operations, enabling caching, reuse of intermediate results and custom pipelines;
* **HPC-friendly**: non-interactive command line tool which is easy to install and run on SLURM;
* **Portable**: should be easy to run on different machines, including lower-end personal computers

## Operators

FrameSense comes with a battery of built-in operators. 

For a complete and up to date list, please use `python framesense.py operators`.

Check the README.md under each operator folder for a specification card. (Work in progress)

### Built-in operators

#### Information

* **operators**:
    List all available operators
* **annotations**:
    List all annotation files
* **collections**:
    List all collections

#### Segmentation

* **[make_clips_ffmpeg](operators/make_clips_ffmpeg/)**:
    Extract clips from videos based on timecodes in annotation files
* **make_shots_scenedetect**:
    Extract shots from clips using PySceneDetect
* **make_frames_ffmpeg**:
    Extract frames from shots using ffmpeg

#### Detection

* **scale_frames_sssabet**:
    Shot scale classification from frames based on //github.com/sssabet/Shot_Type_Classification

### Design principles

It is expected that each operator:
* is functionally minimal ("does one thing and does it well");
* is atomic (only valid and complete output are persisted);
* implements a single method or strategy;
* should only process the input if its output doesn't already exist;
* uses containers to isolate its software dependencies;
* works on all files at one specific level in the hierarchy (e.g. make_shots splits all your clips into shots);
* has a name which reflects what it does, on what unit, with which method (e.g. make_clips_ffmpeg);
* is written as a Python class wihin a module `operator.py` under a package which name matches the name of the operator (e.g. `operators/make_clips_ffmpeg/operator.py`);
* inherits from the [base operator](operators/base/operator.py);

## Feature and Bugs

Please use [github issue tracker](https://github.com/kingsdigitallab/framesense/issues) to report bugs or request new features.

This tool is currently being developped primarily to serve the needs of the [ISSA research project](https://github.com/kingsdigitallab/issa). 
Tickets related to ISSA will therefore take priority. 
Unrelated tickets are welcome but we can't guarantee that they will be addressed promptly or at all
until FrameSense receives more dedicated support (external contributors or additional funding).

## Performance and HPC

We are aiming to support low end (laptop) and high end (HPCs) compute environment. However at the moment supoort is limited and the operators are very slow.

## Testing

See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for details.
