A very basic test suites is in place.

It just runs all operators one by one on a copy of a test collection.

How to run it?

1. activate the python environment for framesense
2. `cd tests`
3. `bash reset_and_test.bash`

If all goes well you should see this line at the end:

`Test suite completed without errors`

If any operation fails, the sequence will stop with a relevant error message.
